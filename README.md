# Description

## Experiment
    - 16 subjects, two acquisition runs of 30 minutes each.
    - The two runs are independent and aleatory presented to the subjects.
    - Each run contains 40 repetitions of 6 stimuli. Stimuli are syllables varying along a continuum from /ba/ syllable to /da/ syllable in one run, and from /da/ syllable to /ta/ syllable in the other run.
    - Ramdom inter-stimulus interval: between 3 to 5 seconds, uniformly distributed
    - Participants stimulated binaurally with intra-aural earphones (air tubes+transducers)
    - Participants were asked to perform an identification task
    - Participants indicated the syllable chosen by pressing a button (with their left or right thumb).

## fMRI acquisition
Images were collected using a Verio 3.0 T (Siemens) whole body and radio frequency coil scanner. The fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent signal (BOLD) was measured using a T2*-weighted echoplanar sequence (repetition time = 2110 ms; echo time = 26 ms; flip angle = 90Â°). Forty contiguous slices (thickness = 3 mm; gap = 15%; matrix size = 64 x 64; voxel size = 3 x 3 x 3 mm3) were acquired per volume. 

## MRI acquisition
A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical image (repetition time = 2300 ms; echo time = 4.18 ms; T1 = 900ms; image matrix  = 256 x 256; slab thickness = 176 mm; spatial resolution = 1 x 1 x 1 mm3) was collected for each participant after functional acquisition.
